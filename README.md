# Workout Tracker


# Description 
Workout Tracker is a program to log cardio and resistance exercises and view them back over time

# How It Works
Mongo database is used to hold 'workout' objects which contain multiple excercises within an array. By clicking the New workout button, a new workout object is created and the list of excercises for that workout starts with the one entered at that time. More excercises can be added by clicking 'continue workout' 

A dashboard showing previous activity can be viewed by clicking on the dasboard link on the upper left corner.
